## About me
I’m a software developer with over than 5 years of experience with different technologies including C, C++, Python(Many modules including requests, asyncio, python-valve etc), Lua and many more.

I’m a big fan of unix based operating systems, my favorite linux distro is Pop os, but I’m currently using windows due to limitations provided by my current work.

I have good experience with server administration of linux and windows servers. I’ve done it for about 6 years. I’ve started from game servers and moved on to more complicated projects.
Currently working for Severstal, developing automation solutions for  inner and outer clients. 

For now I’m open to job offers, I’m looking for something that I will enjoy doing, such as game development or backend development. I’m always ready to learn new technologies and for extending my field of view.
