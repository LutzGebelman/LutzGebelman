## About me

I’m a software developer with more than 5 years experience of work using different technologies including C, C++, Python(Many modules including requests, asyncio, python-valve etc), Lua and many more.

I’m a big fan of unix based operating systems, my favorite linux distro is Fedora with Gnome DE.

I have a lot of experience in server administration of linux and windows servers. I do it for almost 6 years as of now. I’ve started from game servers and moved on to more complicated projects.

For now I’m open to job offers, I’m looking for something that I will enjoy doing, such as game development or backend development. I’m always ready to learn new technologies and to extend my field of view.

My goal for 2022 is to learn Rust and find an opportunity to use it in some interesting project.
